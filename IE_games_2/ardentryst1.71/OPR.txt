Ardentryst Online Play

You may read this at any time from the main menu, and feel free to skip this if you do not intend
to submit your score to the score server.

Rules

By submitting your score to the Ardentryst Online Scoreboard, you agree to these rules:

1. The score is sent from the unaltered Ardentryst game (including its game data files)
2. The score is attained solely by human player(s).
3. You will not use a player name that is derogatory, offensive or anything unsuitable
   for a worldwide audience.
4. There is a chance that the score server flags your score submission as invalid when
   it is legitimate. Disqualification is not permenant, e-mail me and we can sort it out.
   (If this happens, it is a bug in the server code, not a flaw in the algorithm.)

Failure to abide by these rules will result in exclusion of a rank in the scoreboard.
Other than that, you are encouraged to read and edit the source code for your own purpose
(as long as you don't submit a score from that version of the game.)

Press a key.
