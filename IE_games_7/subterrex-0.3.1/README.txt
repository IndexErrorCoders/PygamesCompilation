SubTerrex
---------

Explore deep, dark caves and caverns.

You left click on the rock areas to fire a rope. Make sure you shoot it relatively close to your character and fire it into the body of the rock and not the edge. 

Once you are on the rope you can then move up and down, left and right using WASD keys. You then descend into the cave firing additional ropes in the same way. Left click deploys a new rope and right click does the same but picks up the rope you already deployed. 

You can let go of the rope using Q and if you are swinging near a second rope you can use E to switch between ropes. The key assignments are also shown in the HELP screen. 

To add light you click on the flares at the top right.

Requires: Python 2.7+, pygame 1.9+, pymunk 2.0+ and sci-py

To run the game:

    python subterrex.py
