TACMAN
------

A turn-based, tactical version of PACMAN.

Play a PACMAN clone where the action is turn based. You move and then the 
ghosts move. The turn-based action adds additional tactical elements to the
game and allows you to plan ahead and outwit the ghosts!


Requires: Python 2.6+, pygame 1.9+ and pymunk

To run the game:

    python tacman.py
    

Thanks for playing!
