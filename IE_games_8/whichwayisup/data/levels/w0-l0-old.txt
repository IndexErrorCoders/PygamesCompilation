dialogue ...uh, g'morning.
dialogue Where am I?
dialogue ...
dialogue I guess I really need to lay off the booze.
dialogue I remember something about a key... and some sort of an experiment.
player orientation LEFT
dialogue And it seems like my key has slipped behind those bars.
dialogue Slippery bastard. If only I could reach it...
dialogue ...
dialogue Damn this 2D world. Platforming really isn't my thing.
dialogue I'm more like a shooter guy.
player orientation RIGHT
dialogue But if I really have to, I guess I could try the lever up there.
dialogue You there with the controls, just lay your hand on the arrow keys.
dialogue I jump with the up arrow or Z. Hold it longer, and I'll jump higher.
dialogue You can also use it to slow down falls.
dialogue Collect stuff and pull levers with the down arrow. Got it now?
dialogue Oh, and stay clear of dangers.
dialogue Like, if there are sharp spikes on the floor, don't make me jump on them.
dialogue I can take a few hits, but I'm not the kind of guy that likes pain.
dialogue So just be careful. Please.

dialogue Whoa!
dialogue That was sort of unexpected.
dialogue But I guess I can use it to my advantage.
dialogue This lever seems to have broken, but I wonder what the next one up there does?

dialogue ...
dialogue Hey, what is this?
dialogue This key doesn't fit that door after all. Now what?
dialogue ...
dialogue I guess I'll just have to go to the next level.
