The Primezator 42953 is a puzzle game based on simple math and prime numbers.
The goal is to push around number blocks and get a prime number to put into a door.
Once all the doors are filled and all numbers are used, you complete the level.
Also, if you don't know what's prime and what isn't, the game already labels prime numbers.

Move around the player with the arrow keys.
Pause the game with the spacebar to access the menu.

Adding numbers is as simple as pushing two blocks together.
There are five operation boxes for the remainder of the functions: subtraction, multiplication, division, square, and square root.
Push the blocks into the operation boxes in order to receive a new number.
You cannot take numbers out of the operations, and you cannot receive decimals.
You do not need to use all of the operations in order to win.

A door only takes one prime number, and after that, you can move other blocks over the door.
You cannot pull blocks, so don't get them stuck on an edge or in the corner.

There are 50 levels currently, and they can be edited in the levels folder.
The code system supports up to 100 levels, so you can add in more levels by making new level files.
See levelx.txt for instructions on level building.
If you get stuck, want more levels, or have any questions, send an email.
Submit any levels you've made to me, and I might include them in a new version of this game.
